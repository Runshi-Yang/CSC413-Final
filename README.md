# GAT-PROTAC-Net

Final project CSC413: Neural networks and Deep Learning

The project was completed by Evianne Rovers, Runshi Yang and Kevin Umaiyalan.

In this repository, you will find the following notebooks corresponding to the different models we developed:

- [DeepPROTAC-Original.ipynb](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/DeepPROTAC-Original.ipynb): This notebook contains the implementation of the original DeepPROTACT model which import [`model.py`](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/model.py).
- [DeepPROTAC-Optimized.ipynb](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/DeepPROTAC-Optimized.ipynb): This notebook contains the implementation of the optimized DeepPROTACT model which import [`model_Runshi.py`](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/DeepPROTAC-Optimized.ipynb).
- [DeepPROTAC-Original-over-sampling.ipynb](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/DeepPROTAC-Optimized-over-sampling.ipynb): This notebook contains the implementation of the over-sampling studies for optimized DeepPROTACT model.
- [GAT-PROTAC-Net.ipynb](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/GAT-PROTAC-Net.ipynb): This notebook contains the implementation of the GAT-PROTAC-Net which import [`model_Evianne2.py`](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/model_Evianne2.py).
- [GAT-PROTAC-Net-hyperparameter-optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/GAT-PROTAC-Net-hyperparameter-optimization.ipynb): This notebook contains the implementation of hyperparameter optimization of the GAT-PROTAC-Net.
- [GAT-PROTAC-Net-over-sampling.ipynb](https://github.com/Runshi-Yang/CSC413-Final-Project/blob/main/GAT-PROTAC-Net-over-sampling.ipynb): This notebook contains the implementation of the over-sampling studies for GAT-PROTAC-Net.
